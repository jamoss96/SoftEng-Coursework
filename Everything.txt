-Programming Languages Chosen -
For our programming language we have chosen to use the java programming language. The reasons why we chose to use java over all other programming are that it has excellent cross platform capabilities, you will no have to reprogram you program for each OS, It also has vast amounts of 3rd party libraries as well as documentation which both make life as the programmer a lot easier.
