-Programming Languages Chosen -
For our programming language we have chosen to use the java programming language. The reasons why we chose to use java over 
all other programming are that it has excellent cross platform capabilities, you will no have to reprogram you program for 
each OS, It also has vast amounts of 3rd party libraries as well as documentation which 
both make life as the programmer a lot easier. 

File/Database Systems Chosen - 
For our file/database system we have chosen to use oracle database. The reasons for this are that with us using java to make 
our program it makes it really easy to integrate our database data into our java program and then do stuff with data which 
wouldn't be as easy if we used other systems.
  
- Graphic System ( SWING ) - BRY BRY
To ensure that the chart rendering software functions across all different type of platforms and operating system, we have
decided to use “SWING” graphic system.
Unlike AWT, SWING is a GUI system that utilize AWT and produce images in the form of buttons, textboxes, labels and such that
responds to events like mouse clicking, data entry, while AWT uses the operating system native GUI toolkit for its 
functionality.
Due to this, AWT programs in one machine might not look and function the same on a different machine unless heavy effort is
put into making AWT programs work consistently across platforms. 
Even though SWING may take up slightly more memory space compared to AWT, we ultimately want a graphic system that all the
team members have had experience using and can function consistently across platforms, saving team member’s extra precious
time and effort needed to debug the inconsistencies, keeping in track with already planned schedule.
